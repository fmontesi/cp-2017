	 * This method recursively visits a directory to find all the text files contained in it and its subdirectories.
	 * 
	 * You should consider only files ending with a .txt suffix. You are guaranteed that they will be text files.
	 * 
	 * You can assume that each text file contains a (non-empty) comma-separated sequence of
	 * (positive) numbers. For example: 100,200,34,25
	 * There won't be any new lines, spaces, etc., and the sequence never ends with a comma.
	 * 
	 * The search is recursive: if the directory contains subdirectories,
	 * these are also searched and so on so forth (until there are no more
	 * subdirectories).
	 * 
	 * This method returns a list of results. The list contains a result for each text file that you find.
	 * Each {@link Result} stores the path of its text file, and the average number of the text file (sum of all the numbers found in the text file divided by how many numbers were found in the same text file).
	 * 
	 * @param dir the directory to search
	 * @return a list of results ({@link Result}), each giving the average number found in a file

	 * (parameter dir) such that the condition above is respected.
